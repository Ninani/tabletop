    public static final String description = "Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players, in which the aim is " +
            "to surround more territory than the opponent. The game was invented in ancient China more than 2,500 years ago, " +
            "and is therefore believed to be the oldest board game continuously played today.";

    public static final String longDescription = "Go is an adversarial game with the objective of surrounding a larger total " +
            "area of the board with one's stones than the opponent. As the game progresses, the players position stones on the board " +
            "to map out formations and potential territories. Contests between opposing formations are often extremely complex and " +
            "may result in the expansion, reduction, or wholesale capture and loss of formation stones. A basic principle of Go is " +
            "that a group of stones must have at least one \"liberty\" to remain on the board. A \"liberty\" is an open \"point\" " +
            "(intersection) bordering the group. An enclosed liberty (or liberties) is called an \"eye\", and a group of stones with two" +
            " or more eyes is said to be unconditionally \"alive\". Such groups cannot be captured, even if surrounded. A group with " +
            "one eye or no eyes is \"dead\" and cannot resist eventual capture. The general strategy is to expand one's territory," +
            " attack the opponent's weak groups (groups that can be killed), and always stay mindful of the \"life status\" of one's " +
            "own groups. The liberties of groups are countable. Situations where mutually opposing groups must capture each other" +
            " or die are called capturing races, or semeai. In a capturing race, the group with more liberties (and/or better \"shape\") " +
            "will ultimately be able to capture the opponent's stones. Capturing races and the elements of life or death are the " +
            "primary challenges of Go.A player may pass on determining that the game offers no further opportunities for profitable play. " +
            "The game ends when both players pass, and is then scored. For each player, the number of captured stones komi is " +
            "subtracted from the number of controlled (surrounded) points in \"liberties\" or \"eyes\", and the player with " +
            "the greater score wins the game.";
